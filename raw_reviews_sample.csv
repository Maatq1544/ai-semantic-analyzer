Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン,@rakyll,"It's not perfect and I'm iterating on it but this is where we are right now. If you are skeptical of coding agents, try it on a domain you are already an expert of. Build something complex from scratch where you can be the judge of the artifacts.",Jan 3,5042,231,80
Marco Dewey,@marco_dewey,when will gemini get to this point,Jan 3,262,2,2
Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン,@rakyll,We are working hard right now. The models and the harness.,Jan 3,1400,17,27
justin,@foooorsyth,How detailed was the prompt? Closer to brief ad-hoc description or full-blown PRD?,Jan 3,83,3,2
Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン,@rakyll,It wasn't a very detailed prompt and it contained no real details given I cannot share anything propriety. I was building a toy version on top of some of the existing ideas to evaluate Claude Code. It was a three paragraph description.,Jan 3,626,21,17
pleb,@LifeAberration,"Thank you for sharing that Jaana. I'm curious what made you finally try comparing your work with the work of a coding system now, and what were your expectations before?",Jan 3,61,0,1

Aryan,@AryanTyagi100,Thats crazy! Do you think Google gemini will beat Claude Opus soon,Jan 3,41,0,2
Jaana Dogan ヤナ ドガン,@rakyll,Beating is the goal. Anthropic has done a great job building their harness. It's great to see this kind of progress even it's coming from a competitor.,Jan 3,633,22,11
Thomas Power,@thomaspower,"This is the quiet shockwave moment. It's not that Claude coded faster. It's that a clear problem description now compresses a year of committee debate, alignment friction, and orchestration overhead into an hour. The bottleneck has shifted: from implementation to articulation",Jan 3,115,16,5

Kirk Marple,@KirkMarple,"Was it that Claude could ignore the team dynamics and make decisions, which were holding it back last year? Or more, the learnings of the last year made it easier to create a new, clean version from scratch?",Jan 3,531,25,2

nicholas,@nnnnicholas,"The problem with this post is that you shift the goal posts. In the problem statement, the issue was not everyone is aligned. In the solution, Claude Code generates what you built in the last year. If you give them whatever Claude Code came up with, they will still not be",Jan 4,8,0,2
Jack Vinijtrongjit,@juminoz,"If there are multiple options and it takes even just a week to implement each prototype, why not just do them all and make them compete? This is where I have always seen as an issue with companies like Google. Just move fast and let the results make the decision for you.",Jan 3,15,3,4

AJ,@alojoh,Before you started the project last year would you have been able to promote the problem sufficiently? Perhaps the value of the project was to be able to adequately describe the problem.,Jan 3,19,0,2
Milk Road AI,@MilkRoadAI,Truly wild! This is a MASSIVE moment for the tech industry. A Principal Engineer at Google publicly admitted that a competitor's AI tool solved a problem in one hour that her team of human experts had been struggling with for over a year.,Jan 3,1,1,0
